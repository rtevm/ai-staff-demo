};
```

## Step 5: Launch Your Agent

### Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] Role clearly defined
- [ ] Integrations connected
- [ ] Success metrics set
- [ ] Initial tasks assigned
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

### Deployment

1. Click "Deploy Agent"
2. Review configuration summary
3. Confirm deployment
4. Monitor initial performance

## Step 6: Monitor and Optimize

### Real-Time Dashboard

Access your dashboard to see:
- Active agent status
- Task completion rates
- Performance metrics
- Recent decisions
- Upcoming actions

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Example: Adjusting agent parameters based on performance
if agent.success_rate < 0.8:
    agent.increase_validation_threshold()
    agent.request_human_review_for_edge_cases()
elif agent.success_rate > 0.95:
    agent.increase_autonomy_level()
    agent.expand_decision_authority()
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. LinkedIn Growth Campaign

```yaml
project: "LinkedIn Presence Enhancement"
duration: "3 months"
agents:
  - marketing_director
  - content_creator
  - analytics_specialist

week_1_tasks:
  - analyze_competitor_profiles
  - identify_content_gaps
  - create_content_calendar
  
week_2_tasks:
  - produce_10_posts
  - schedule_publications
  - engage_with_audience
```

### 2. Financial Optimization

```yaml
project: "Reduce Burn Rate"
duration: "1 month"
agents:
  - cfo_agent
  
immediate_actions:
  - audit_all_subscriptions
  - negotiate_vendor_contracts
  - implement_approval_workflows
  - create_budget_forecasts
```

### 3. Grant Application

```yaml
project: "SBIR Phase I Application"
duration: "6 weeks"
agents:
  - grant_writer
  - research_coordinator
  
milestones:
  week_1: "opportunity_research"

  week_4: "review_and_refine"
  week_5: "final_submission"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
- Deploy one agent first
- Prove value before scaling
- Learn from initial deployment

### 2. Clear Communication
- Set explicit expectations
- Define success criteria
- Regular check-ins initially

### 3. Iterative Improvement
- Monitor performance daily (first week)
- Adjust parameters based on results
- Expand gradually

### 4. Human-AI Collaboration
- Agents augment, not replace
- Maintain oversight on critical decisions
- Use escalation for edge cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Performing as Expected
```python
# Diagnostic steps
agent.analyze_recent_decisions()
agent.identify_pattern_mismatches()
agent.suggest_configuration_adjustments()
```

#### Integration Errors
```python
# Check connection status
integration.test_connection()
integration.validate_credentials()
integration.check_rate_limits()
```

#### Performance Degradation
```python
# Performance optimization
agent.clear_cache()
agent.optimize_decision_trees()
agent.update_knowledge_base()
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Enable agents to work together:

```python
# Create agent team
team = AgentTeam([
    marketing_director,
    cfo_agent,
    project_manager
])

# Define collaboration rules
team.set_communication_protocol("async")
team.enable_resource_sharing()
team.set_conflict_resolution("consensus")
```

### Custom Workflows

Create complex automation flows:

```python
workflow = Workflow("Customer Onboarding")
workflow.add_step(sales_agent, "qualify_lead")
workflow.add_step(onboarding_agent, "setup_account")
workflow.add_step(success_agent, "schedule_training")
workflow.add_step(finance_agent, "process_payment")
workflow.deploy()
```

### Machine Learning Integration

Enable continuous improvement:

```python
# Enable learning mode
agent.enable_ml_optimization()
agent.set_learning_rate(0.1)
agent.track_outcome_correlation()
agent.auto_adjust_parameters()
```
